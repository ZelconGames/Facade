Cloning
-------
If you clone this using the usual `git clone git://github.com/ZelconGames/Facade.git`
run `git submodule update --init` before anything else, within the 
cloned repo.
Alternatively, you can just clone with `git clone --recursive git://github.com/ZelconGames/Facade.git`
and it will do that for you.
This will get our Ducttape sub-module that is in a different git repo to keep this one tidy.

Building
--------
Coming Soon!
