Cloning
-------
If you clone this using the usual `git clone git://github.com/ZelconGames/Facade.git`
please run `git submodule update --init` as the first thing you do within the 
cloned repo.
Alternatively, you can just clone with `git clone --recursive git://github.com/ZelconGames/Facade.git`
and it will do that for you.
This will get our ducttape external that is in a different git repo to keep this one
clean and dandy.

Building

Coming Soon!
